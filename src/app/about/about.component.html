                        The deployed application utilizes four endpoints from the IEX Trading APIs. The .NET Core 
                        backend was written to retrieve the desired stock information and store it into an SQL 
                        Database on Azure Cloud. <i>(We only stored a few stock symbols to the database such as:
                        AAPL, MSFT, KO).</i> The .NET Core provides the API service to the front end which 
                        was wrtten in Angular 7 and utilizing HighCharts for charting. The final app is deployed
                        to Azure Cloud.
