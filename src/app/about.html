            <h2>How To Use the Best Dividend Stocks List?</h2>
            <p>
                The stocks featured on our Best Dividend Stocks List are geared toward traditional long-term investors looking to boost their current income stream, while at the same time maintaining a relatively low risk profile. The stocks above have been hand picked
                by Dividend.com staff, which utilizes proprietary research and analysis to determine the best and safest dividend stocks to buy with “new money.” Our list contains compelling dividend paying stocks that have been thoroughly vetted and
                feature exceptional ratings.Our list is not meant to represent a complete portfolio, nor is every stock on this list appropriate for all investors. We highly encourage investors to do their own research before making any investment decision.
                When we remove a name from our “Recommended” dividend stocks list, that downgrade generally means that we no longer recommend adding to existing positions, or establishing new positions in that stock. More importantly, a removal from our
                list is almost never a “Sell” call. On very rare occasions we may issue “Sell” calls if we feel the situation dictates. We also recommend investors to develop their own sell strategies to limit losses.When a stock is added to our list,
                that means the stock’s ratings have been upgraded from “Neutral” to “Recommended.” This change is also known as a “Buy” call.

            <h2>How to pick best dividend stock?</h2>
            <p>
                BONZAI was founded to make dividend investing easier for long-term and income-seeking investors. Much of our dividend research is compiled in our proprietary rating system, known as DARS™ (Dividend Advantage Rating System). Below is a detailed look at
                how we rate dividend stocks. The relative strength of a dividend stock indicates whether the stock is uptrending or not. The major determining factor in this rating is whether the stock is trading close to its 52-week-high. If a stock’s
                yield is above or near the market average then it will be rated higher within this parameter. High dividend yields (usually over 10%) should be considered extremely risky, while low dividend yields (1% or less) are simply not very beneficial
                to long-term investors. A stock’s dividend reliability is determined by a healthy payout ratio that is higher than other stocks. A company that pays out close to half its earnings as dividends and retains the other half of earnings has
                ample room to grow its business and pay out more dividends in the future. A stock’s Dividend Uptrend rating is dependent on the company’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to evaluate whether or not a stock’s dividend is likely to trend upward.
                If a stock is valued near, or slightly below the market average, research has shown that the market expects the stock’s dividend to increase. A stock’s Earnings Growth rating evaluates a company’s expected EPS for the current financial
                year and compares it to next financial year’s expected EPS. Stocks with single-digit growth estimates will have a higher rating than others, as our research has shown that well-established dividend-paying companies have modest earnings
                growth estimates.
